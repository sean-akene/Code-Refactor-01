Horiseon Code Refactor

## Aim
The aim of this project was to make the Horiseon homepage more accessible as well as to clean up the html and CSS stylesheet and make it more readable.
The changes to this page ensure that a user does not face any difficulty navigating through the Horiseon website. 
 
## Installation
In order to install and run this project, you will need to clone my github repositroy, and the use a text editor such as Visual Studio Code to view and edit the HTML and CSS stylesheet. The code can also be viewed via an internet browser by using developer tools, which can be accessed using the shortcut  Option + Command + J on  macOS or Shift + CTRL + J on Windows/Linux. 

## Edits
The Horiseon homepage was made more accessible by carrying out the following edits:
1. Fixing the "Search Engine Optimization" link by adding a link id in the 	html code. Prior to this fix, the link was completely unresponsive. 

2. Making the page 508 compliant by adding descriptive alt tags to images, and  increasing the font-size of the page. The main image of the page was also reduced to make the page easier to navigate. The alt tag will serve as a written description of the the images.  

3. Auditing the code and ensuring that the CSS is more accurate and erasing a few redundant classes and id's in the html code. The CSS stlyesheet was previously a lot longer than it needed to be.
